## Long version (first person)
I'm an artist and designer working on tangible products, experiences, and new realities. My research spans across different media, looking at our relationships with machines and technology through design and creativity.
I'm a creative director at oio, a new studio based in London and Shanghai, that I also co-founded. At oio, we research and develop wild experiments at the edge of design and technology. Before that, I was a creative technologist at Google Creative Lab. I talk about design and creativity in universities, museums, and hackspaces around the world. My work is occasionally exhibited in places such as MoMA in New York, V&A in London, or Triennale in Milan. Some of the projects I worked on received a few awards, including Red Dot Design Award, D&AD pencils, IXDA Award, and Cannes Lions.
